# Token Contract

This Solidity program demonstrates the creation of a basic token contract that includes functionality for minting, burning, and managing token balances. It showcases essential Solidity concepts and serves as a foundation for understanding token mechanics on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Description

This program is a simple token contract written in Solidity, a programming language for creating smart contracts. The contract includes public variables to store token details (name, abbreviation, and total supply), a mapping to maintain balances for different addresses, and functions to mint and burn tokens. The mint function allows tokens to be added to an address, while the burn function enables tokens to be reduced with safeguards to prevent invalid operations. This program is an ideal starting point for building more advanced token contracts.
